## HTML - Hypertext Markup Language
  - HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages.
    - HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.
    - HTML elements are represented by tags.

 -  HTML puts information on a webpage, and CSS positions that information, gives it color, changes the font, and makes it look great!
    - HTML is a markup language, not a programming language.
    - HTML is not case-sensitive, but it is recommended to use lowercase for tags and attributes.
    - HTML is a static language, meaning it does not have any dynamic features like JavaScript.
    - HTML is a declarative language, meaning it describes what the content is, not how to display it.
    - HTML is a semantic language, meaning it describes the meaning of the content, not just the appearance.
    - HTML is a platform-independent language, meaning it can be used on any operating system or device.
    - HTML is an open standard, meaning it is free to use and implement.
